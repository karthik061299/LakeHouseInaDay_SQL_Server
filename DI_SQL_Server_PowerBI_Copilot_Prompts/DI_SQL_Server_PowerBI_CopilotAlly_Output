Create a KPI Card visual to display the total active headcount. Use Go_Dim_New_Monthly_HC_Report[Emp_Status] filtered to 'Active' and Go_Dim_New_Monthly_HC_Report[gci_id] with a DISTINCTCOUNT aggregation. Title the card 'Total Active Employees', use a large bold font, and apply corporate blue (#0078D4) for the value.

Add a Gauge Chart to show the overall utilization rate. Use SUM of Go_Agg_Resource_Utilization[approved_hours] as the numerator and SUM of Go_Dim_New_Monthly_HC_Report[Expected_Hrs] as the denominator, with a target value of 0.85. Format the gauge with green for above target, orange for near target, and red for below target, and label it 'Overall Utilization Rate'.

Add a KPI Card with trend indicator to display total gross profit. Use SUM of Go_Dim_New_Monthly_HC_Report[GP] for the current value and calculate month-over-month growth using Go_Dim_New_Monthly_HC_Report[YYMM]. Title the card 'Total Gross Profit', show the trend as a small sparkline, and use green for positive growth and red for negative growth.

Add a Clustered Column Chart to visualize headcount by department or practice. Use Go_Dim_New_Monthly_HC_Report[Practice_type] as the axis and DISTINCTCOUNT of Go_Dim_New_Monthly_HC_Report[gci_id] (filtered to 'Active') as the value, with Go_Dim_New_Monthly_HC_Report[YYMM] as a slicer. Label axes clearly and use contrasting colors for each practice.

Add a Line and Clustered Column Chart to show new hires versus terminations trend over time. Use Go_Dim_New_Monthly_HC_Report[start_date], Go_Dim_New_Monthly_HC_Report[termdate], and Go_Dim_New_Monthly_HC_Report[YYMM]. Plot new hires and terminations as columns, and net headcount change as a line. Format with date on the X-axis and clear legends.

Add a Donut Chart to display the distribution of billable versus non-billable hours. Use Go_Fact_vw_billing_timesheet_daywise_ne[billable] as the category and SUM of Go_Fact_vw_billing_timesheet_daywise_ne[approved_hours_st] as the value. Show percentage labels inside the donut and use blue for billable and gray for non-billable.

Add a Stacked Column Chart to break down daily timesheet hours. Use Go_Fact_Timesheet[pe_date] on the X-axis and SUM of Go_Fact_Timesheet[ST], [OT], [DT], and [TIME_OFF] as stacked values. Title the chart 'Daily Timesheet Hours Breakdown' and use distinct colors for each hour type.

Add a Treemap to analyze revenue by client. Use Go_Dim_New_Monthly_HC_Report[client_code] as the group and SUM of Go_Dim_New_Monthly_HC_Report[GP] as the value. Display average bill rate (Go_Dim_New_Monthly_HC_Report[NBR]) in tooltips. Format with client names as labels and size representing revenue contribution.

Add a Line Chart with markers to show profit margin trend over time. Use Go_Dim_New_Monthly_HC_Report[YYMM] as the X-axis, calculate profit margin percentage using SUM of Go_Dim_New_Monthly_HC_Report[GP] minus SUM of Go_Dim_report_392_all[salary], divided by SUM of Go_Dim_New_Monthly_HC_Report[GP]. Add a reference line at 25% and use blue for the trend line.

Add a Matrix visual with conditional formatting as a project utilization heatmap. Use Go_Agg_Resource_Utilization[ITSSProjectName] as rows, Go_Agg_Resource_Utilization[YYMM] as columns, and AVERAGE of Go_Agg_Resource_Utilization[project_utilization] as values. Apply color scale: green for >=0.9, orange for >=0.8, yellow for >=0.7, red for below target.

Add a Clustered Bar Chart to show resource allocation by skills or practice. Use Go_Dim_New_Monthly_HC_Report[Practice_type] or [vertical] as the category and SUM of Go_Agg_Resource_Utilization[billed_fte] and [total_fte] to calculate allocation rate. Display allocation rate as data labels and use horizontal bars for readability.

Add a Gauge Chart to visualize timesheet submission compliance. Use COUNTROWS of Go_Fact_Timesheet for actual submissions and CROSSJOIN of Go_Dim_New_Monthly_HC_Report[gci_id] and dates for expected submissions. Calculate compliance rate and set the target at 100%. Use green for compliant, red for non-compliant, and label as 'Submission Compliance'.

Add a Table visual with data bars for employee performance scorecard. Use Go_Dim_New_Monthly_HC_Report[merged_name] as rows and calculated measures for utilization, revenue, and performance score as columns. Apply conditional formatting with data bars and color scale, and enable sorting by performance score.
