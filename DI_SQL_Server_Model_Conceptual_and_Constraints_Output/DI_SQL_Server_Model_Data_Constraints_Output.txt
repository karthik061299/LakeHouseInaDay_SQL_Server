SECTION 5: IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. CONSTRAINT IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES

   Priority 1 (Critical):
   • Implement NOT NULL constraints on mandatory fields
   • Establish primary key and unique constraints
   • Create foreign key relationships for referential integrity
   • Implement timestamp/audit fields for data lineage

   Priority 2 (High):
   • Implement check constraints for domain values
   • Create validation rules for date logic
   • Implement calculated field validations
   • Establish cross-table consistency checks

   Priority 3 (Medium):
   • Implement business rule validations
   • Create data quality monitoring
   • Establish exception handling processes
   • Implement data reconciliation procedures

2. DATA QUALITY MONITORING

   • Establish automated data quality checks
   • Monitor constraint violations
   • Track data completeness metrics
   • Generate data quality scorecards
   • Implement alerting for critical issues

3. GOVERNANCE AND COMPLIANCE

   • Document all business rules and constraints
   • Establish change management processes
   • Implement access controls and security
   • Maintain audit trails
   • Conduct regular compliance reviews
