SECTION 4: ALIGNMENT WITH REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

1. MONTHLY HEADCOUNT REPORTING
   • Source: source_layer.New_Monthly_HC_Report
   • Key Metrics: Begin HC, Starts, Terms, End HC, Net Addition
   • Dimensions: Market, Client, Practice, Vertical, Employee Category
   • Period: Monthly (YYMM field)
   • Business Rules: Headcount calculation formulas, movement tracking

2. TIMESHEET AND BILLING REPORTING
   • Sources: source_layer.Timesheet_New, vw_billing_timesheet_daywise_ne, 
              vw_consultant_timesheet_daywise
   • Key Metrics: ST, OT, DT hours, Billable vs. Non-billable
   • Dimensions: Employee (GCI_ID), Period (PE_DATE), Task
   • Business Rules: Time entry rules, approval workflow, billing calculations

3. WORKFORCE ANALYTICS
   • Source: source_layer.report_392_all
   • Key Metrics: Utilization, GP, GPM, Bill rates, Pay rates
   • Dimensions: Employee, Client, Project, Manager, Location
   • Business Rules: Financial calculations, organizational hierarchy

4. HIRING AND ONBOARDING TRACKING
   • Sources: source_layer.SchTask, source_layer.Hiring_Initiator_Project_Info
   • Key Metrics: Workflow status, Time to hire, Approval levels
   • Dimensions: Candidate, Requisition, Hiring manager, Recruiter
   • Business Rules: Workflow progression, approval requirements

5. CAPACITY PLANNING

   • Business Rules: Location-specific calendars, capacity calculations

================================================================================
SECTION 5: DATA MODEL INTEGRITY RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. IMPLEMENT FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINTS
   • Add FK from Timesheet_New.gci_id to employee master table
   • Add FK from SchTask.Process_ID to workflow process definition
   • Add FK from Hiring_Initiator_Project_Info.ID to SchTask.ID
   • Enforce referential integrity across all related tables

2. ADD CHECK CONSTRAINTS
   • Date range validations (start <= end)
   • Numeric range validations (hours >= 0, rates > 0)
   • Status value validations (predefined list)
   • Percentage sum validations (Region1% + Region2% = 100)

3. CREATE INDEXES FOR PERFORMANCE
   • Index on GCI_ID in all tables for employee lookups
   • Index on PE_DATE in timesheet tables for period queries
   • Index on YYMM in monthly report table for period analysis
   • Composite indexes on frequently joined columns

4. IMPLEMENT AUDIT TRIGGERS
   • Track all changes to critical fields (rates, dates, status)
   • Maintain audit history with user and timestamp
   • Log data quality issues for remediation
   • Monitor constraint violations

5. ESTABLISH DATA QUALITY MONITORING
   • Regular validation of referential integrity
   • Completeness checks for mandatory fields
   • Consistency checks across related tables
   • Anomaly detection for outlier values

6. DOCUMENT BUSINESS RULE EXCEPTIONS
   • Process for handling rule violations
   • Approval workflow for exceptions
   • Documentation requirements for overrides
   • Periodic review of exception patterns

================================================================================
SECTION 6: COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

1. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
   • Employment law compliance (visa, work authorization)
   • Tax compliance (W2, 1099 classification)
   • Labor law compliance (overtime rules, breaks)
   • Industry-specific regulations (client requirements)

2. DATA PRIVACY COMPLIANCE
   • PII (Personally Identifiable Information) protection
   • GDPR compliance for international employees
   • Data access controls and audit trails
   • Right to erasure and data portability support

3. FINANCIAL COMPLIANCE
   • Revenue recognition standards (ASC 606)
   • Expense tracking and allocation
   • Audit trail requirements
   • SOX compliance for financial reporting

4. CLIENT CONTRACTUAL COMPLIANCE
   • MSP program requirements
   • Client-specific compliance checks
   • SLA (Service Level Agreement) adherence
   • Invoicing and payment term compliance

CONCLUSION
================================================================================

This document provides comprehensive data expectations, constraints, and 
business rules derived from the source data model structure. These 
specifications ensure:

• Data integrity through enforced constraints
• Business logic consistency through defined rules
• Compliance with regulatory and contractual requirements
• Accurate and reliable reporting capabilities
• Maintainable and scalable data architecture

All stakeholders should review these specifications and provide feedback to 
ensure alignment with actual business requirements and reporting needs. Any 
deviations from these rules should be documented and approved through the 
established change management process.
