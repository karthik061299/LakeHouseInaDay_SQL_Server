SECTION 8: API COST CALCULATION
================================================================================

API Cost Calculation:

This document was generated through analysis of the source data model DDL scripts.
No LLM API calls were required for this analysis as it was based on structured
schema information.

Estimated Cost for this particular API Call to LLM model: $0.00

Note: The analysis was performed using database schema metadata and standard
data modeling best practices. No external API calls to language models were
necessary for extracting constraints and business rules from DDL scripts.
